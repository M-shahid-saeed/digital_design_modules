# Digital Design Modules

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **digital design modules** implemented in HDL (Verilog/VHDL).  
It includes fundamental building blocks used in FPGA and digital logic projects.

All modules are designed to be **modular, reusable, and synthesizable**, making them suitable for academic, hobby, and professional FPGA projects.
